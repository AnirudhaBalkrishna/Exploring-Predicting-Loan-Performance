# Exploring-Predicting-Loan-Performance

This academic project was part of UIC's Data Mining course. The project required us to analyze data regarding the performance of loans. We were tasked to explore various patterns, key metrics and possibilities of data leakage. Next, we had to design various statistical models like Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosted trees etc. and select the best model based on certain business metrics.
